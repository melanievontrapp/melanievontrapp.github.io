        <h2 class="paragraph">Going to the polls will require some planning ahead.
            To find out where your closest poll booth is located check your county’s election site.
            Due to voting day occuring on a Tuesday, you will need to arrange with your work schedule to get that time off.
            Typically poll booths are open from 7am-7pm.

        <h1 class="header">Mailing Your Ballot</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">Some states also allow voters to cast their vote by mail. Voters will receive an official ballot to complete and insert into the security envelope which is placed in the ballot return envelope and signed by the voter. The ballot return envelope can be stamped and mailed or dropped off at any official drop box across the state. If a voter casts their ballot after the Wednesday before an election, the ballot should be left at a drop box site to ensure it’s counted.

            Ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. </p>

        <h1 class="splash-two">Absentee Voting</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">Students attending an out-of-state college or voters traveling during an election can still recieve a ballot. Fill out an absentee ballot request form your county’s elections office and return it.
        </p>

        <h1 class="splash-two">Age and Citizenship Concerns</h1>


        <p class="paragraph">If you are 16 years old, you will not receive a ballot until an election occurs on or after your 18th birthday. If you will receive your citizenship on or before an election, you must submit a voter registration card before the 21-day voter registration deadline. After taking your oath, you must appear and provide evidence of citizenship to the elections office in the county where you live, on or before Election Day. </p>
